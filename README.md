Introduction:
Project Overview:
The Database that we have created in this project is :  This database represents a small sized restaurant . It stores all the data required to function a restaurant properly. This project involves designing a database to store the details of the student, order, staff, faculty, person, driver, menu, vehicle, location and delivery.

Project Introduction:
Due to the Corona virus, food delivery services have become one of the most worrisome sectors. Local businesses are seeking for simple solutions to deliver food to customers rather than hiring outside workers to do it. Many experts anticipate that food delivery would have become a part of our daily routine even when items that were affected by the Corona virus have returned to normal. While on campus, students prefer to get food from delivery services. The frequent influx of guests, who may or may not be linked with the university, irritates university employees. Although companies such as UberEats and GrubHub are happy to deliver on campus, several universities are debating whether they should take control of delivery and ensure that only students and authorised university employees bring food on campus for safety and health reasons.
Business Rules:
-	University members are only eligible to use the system.
-	Outside the university members are not eligible to use the system.
-	Ratings are optional
-	Each order has one rating

Reverse Engineer:
Database reverse engineering is the process through which the logical and conceptual schemas of a legacy database, or of a set of files, are reconstructed from various information sources such as DDL code, data dictionary contents, database contents or the source code of application programs that use the database.
